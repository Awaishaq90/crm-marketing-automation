# ðŸ“§ Simple Email Reply Setup (No Webhooks Required)

Since Resend doesn't have `email.received` webhooks in all plans, here's a simple approach that works reliably.

## ðŸŽ¯ What We're Setting Up

- Send emails from `zara@interact.timetechnologiesllc.com`
- Receive all replies in your main email inbox
- Track replies manually in your CRM (or implement a simple automation later)

## ðŸš€ Simple Setup (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Add Domain to Resend

1. **Go to Resend Dashboard**
   - Navigate to "Domains"
   - Click "Add Domain"
   - Enter: `interact.timetechnologiesllc.com`

### Step 2: Configure DNS Records

Add these records in your domain provider:

**SPF Record:**
```
Type: TXT
Name: @
Value: v=spf1 include:_spf.resend.com ~all
```

**DKIM Record:**
```
Type: TXT
Name: resend._domainkey
Value: [Copy from Resend dashboard]
```

**MX Record (for receiving emails):**
```
Type: MX
Name: @
Value: feedback-smtp.us-east-1.amazonses.com
Priority: 10
```

### Step 3: Set Up Email Forwarding

**Option A: Resend Forwarding (Recommended)**

1. **In Resend Dashboard:**
   - Go to your domain settings
   - Look for "Email Forwarding" or "Catch-all" or "Inbound Email"
   - Set up forwarding rule:
     ```
     From: *@interact.timetechnologiesllc.com
     To: your-gmail@gmail.com
     ```
   - **Replace `your-gmail@gmail.com` with your actual Gmail address**

2. **If you have multiple sender emails, set up individual rules:**
   ```
   Rule 1: zara@interact.timetechnologiesllc.com â†’ your-gmail@gmail.com
   Rule 2: sales@interact.timetechnologiesllc.com â†’ your-gmail@gmail.com
   Rule 3: support@interact.timetechnologiesllc.com â†’ your-gmail@gmail.com
   ```

**Option B: Gmail Rules (Alternative)**

1. **In Gmail Settings:**
   - Go to Settings â†’ Filters and Blocked Addresses
   - Create new filter:
     - From: `zara@interact.timetechnologiesllc.com`
     - To: `your-gmail@gmail.com`
   - Action: Forward to your main email

2. **Repeat for each sender email:**
   - `sales@interact.timetechnologiesllc.com`
   - `support@interact.timetechnologiesllc.com`

### Step 4: Test the Setup

1. **Send a test email from your CRM**
2. **Reply to that email from another account**
3. **Check your main email - you should receive the reply**

## ðŸ“± Manual Reply Tracking

Since we don't have automatic webhook integration, here's how to track replies:

### Method 1: Manual Tracking
1. **When you receive a reply:**
   - Go to the contact in your CRM
   - Add a note about the reply
   - Update lead status if needed
   - Pause any active sequences for that contact

### Method 2: Gmail Rules + Zapier (Semi-Automated)

1. **Set up Gmail Rules:**
   - Create a label: "CRM Replies"
   - Rule: If from contains `interact.timetechnologiesllc.com`, apply label

2. **Connect to Zapier:**
   - Create Zapier account
   - Connect Gmail to Zapier
   - When email with "CRM Replies" label is received
   - Send webhook to your CRM API

3. **Update your CRM API:**
   - Create endpoint to receive reply data
   - Update contact status
   - Pause sequences

## ðŸ”§ Advanced: Custom Email Parser

If you want full automation, you can set up a custom email parser:

### Using Mailgun (Recommended)

1. **Sign up for Mailgun**
2. **Add your domain to Mailgun**
3. **Set up incoming email routing:**
   ```
   Route: *@interact.timetechnologiesllc.com
   Action: Forward to webhook
   Webhook: https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/email-replies
   ```

4. **Update your webhook endpoint** to handle Mailgun format

### Using Postmark

1. **Sign up for Postmark**
2. **Add your domain**
3. **Set up inbound email processing**
4. **Configure webhook to your CRM**

## ðŸ“Š What You Get

With this simple setup:

âœ… **Professional Emails**: Send from `zara@interact.timetechnologiesllc.com`
âœ… **Reply Forwarding**: All replies go to your main email
âœ… **Manual Tracking**: Add reply notes in CRM
âœ… **Sequence Control**: Manually pause sequences when needed

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. **Start with the simple setup** (email forwarding)
2. **Test thoroughly** with multiple sender emails
3. **Add manual tracking** for replies
4. **Consider automation** later with Zapier or custom parser

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

- **Use email labels** in Gmail to organize replies
- **Set up email templates** for common responses
- **Create CRM shortcuts** for quick reply tracking
- **Monitor reply rates** to improve your sequences
